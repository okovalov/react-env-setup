# Setup React application.

This is a proposal on how to setup project.

If you would like to get more information on what package was included and what was the reason, then [visit PACKAGE_INFO file](PACKAGE_INFO.md)

## How to setup?

## How to run in development?

## How to prepare code for production?

## How to commit any changes?

Commit message should follow the next pattern:

  1:Scope : 2:explanation what was done

where:

  1:Scope - could be one of the labels:

    - **Example**: should be used to describe any changes that was done to the code in **src** folder
    - **Dev**: should be used to describe any changes in environment configuration (webpack, babel, etc.)
    - **Comments**: should be used to describe any changes to documentation (README, JSDOCS)

## Known issues.

## TODO.

[] Add JSDOCS
[] Add GIT hook scripts to check commit massages and to run tests on commit
[] Add React router
