# Setup React application.

This is a proposal on how to setup project.
If you would like to get more information on what package was included and what was the reason, then [visit PACKAGE_INFO file](PACKAGE_INFO.md)

## Example project

Project's requirements are [here](PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md)

## How to setup?

## How to run in development?

## How to prepare code for production?

## How to commit any changes?

Commit message should follow the next pattern:

    1:Scope : 2:explanation what was done

where:

**1:Scope** - could be one of the labels:

  - **Example**: should be used to describe any changes that was done to the code in **src** folder
  - **Dev**: should be used to describe any changes in environment configuration (webpack, babel, etc.)
  - **Comments**: should be used to describe any changes to documentation (README, JSDOCS)
